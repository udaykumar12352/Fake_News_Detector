## 🛠️ Technical Details

### Models Used

1. **DistilBERT**
   - Deep semantic understanding using a transformer-based model that manages contextual analysis and subtle linguistic patterns.
   - It makes use of contextual language understanding and is typically more accurate than conventional machine learning models.

2. **Traditional ML Models**
   - XGBoost: Gradient boosting for structured data
   - Random Forest: Ensemble of decision trees
   - LightGBM: Light gradient boosting machine
   - Logistic Regression: Linear classification

### How It Works

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercase conversion
   - Special character removal
   - Stopword removal
   - Stemming

2. **Model Prediction**
   - Each model analyzes the preprocessed text
   - BERT model uses transformer architecture
   - Other models use TF-IDF features

3. **Consensus Voting System**
   The system uses a weighted voting mechanism to determine the final prediction:
   
   - **Vote Weighting:**
     - BERT model gets 2 votes (counted twice)
     - All other models get 1 vote each
     - Total votes = Number of models + 1 (because BERT counts twice)
   
   - **Example Calculation:**
     ```
     Models: BERT, XGBoost, Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression
     Total votes = 6 (5 models + 1 extra for BERT)
     
     If BERT predicts FAKE:
     - BERT: 2 votes for FAKE
     - Other models: 1 vote each
     - Need > 3 votes (50% of 6) for FAKE consensus
     ```
   
   - **Decision Making:**
     - If more than 50% of total votes are "FAKE" → Final prediction is FAKE
     - Otherwise → Final prediction is REAL
   
   - **Example Scenarios:**
     ```
     Scenario 1:
     - BERT: FAKE (2 votes)
     - XGBoost: FAKE (1 vote)
     - Random Forest: FAKE (1 vote)
     - LightGBM: REAL (1 vote)
     - Logistic Regression: REAL (1 vote)
     Total: 4 FAKE votes out of 6 → Consensus: FAKE

     Scenario 2:
     - BERT: REAL (2 votes)
     - XGBoost: FAKE (1 vote)
     - Random Forest: FAKE (1 vote)
     - LightGBM: REAL (1 vote)
     - Logistic Regression: REAL (1 vote)
     Total: 3 FAKE votes out of 6 → Consensus: REAL
     ```

   - **Why BERT gets 2 votes:**
     - More sophisticated model architecture
     - Better at understanding context and nuance
     - Generally higher accuracy in practice
     - Can better handle complex language patterns

   This weighted voting system ensures:
   - BERT's prediction has more influence
   - System is robust against individual model errors
   - Final decision considers both traditional ML and transformer-based approaches

## 🎯 Usage Example

```python
# Example article
article = """
[Your news article text here]
"""

# Get predictions
results, consensus = predict_single_article(article)
print(f"Consensus: {consensus}")
for model, prediction in results.items():
    print(f"{model}: {prediction['label']} ({prediction['confidence']}%)")
```

## 📊 Performance

- **Accuracy**: Varies by model (BERT typically highest)
- **Speed**: 
  - BERT: ~1-2 seconds per article
  - Other models: < 1 second per article
- **Memory Usage**: ~500MB-1GB (mainly due to BERT model)
